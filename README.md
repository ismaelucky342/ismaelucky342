# About me 

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at U-tad. Additionally, I am a member of 42 Madrid, a programming school that embraces a disruptive peer-to-peer learning model. The synergy between these educational approaches enables me to engage in hands-on practical learning while maintaining a strong theoretical foundation and academic rigor at my university. I later apply this knowledge to real-world projects at 42, where adaptability and teamwork are highly encouraged.
